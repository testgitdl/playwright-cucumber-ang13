# DUIF OCEAN E2E API

The DUIF OCEAN E2E API is a library containing page objects and utility functions to help client projects in interacting with the DUIF web elements (ocean-button, ocean-checkbox, etc).

The Dynamic UI Framework uses the API itself for its end to end tests.

The web e2e tool used was migrated from Protractor to Playwright and these are the Playwright page objects
